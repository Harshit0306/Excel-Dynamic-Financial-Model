# Dynamic 4-Year Profit and Loss (P&L) Statement and Financial Forecasting Model

## Overview

This project features a comprehensive and dynamic 4-year Profit and Loss (P&L) statement and financial forecasting model developed in Microsoft Excel. The model is designed to provide scenario-based projections and analysis, enabling users to perform detailed financial planning and sensitivity analysis.

## Features

- **Dynamic 4-Year P&L Statement**: Tracks revenue, expenses, and net income over a 4-year period.
- **Financial Forecasting**: Allows users to forecast future financial performance based on historical data and assumptions.
- **Scenario-Based Projections**: Utilizes Excel’s Scenario Manager to create and compare different financial scenarios.
- **Data Tables**: Employs Data Tables for sensitivity analysis, helping users understand the impact of changes in key variables on financial outcomes.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Enables users to analyze how changes in assumptions (e.g., sales growth rates, cost of goods sold, etc.) affect the financial projections.

## Tools and Techniques

- **Excel Data Tables**: Used for organizing and summarizing data to facilitate sensitivity analysis.
- **Scenario Manager**: Utilized for creating and managing different financial scenarios.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Applied to assess the impact of changes in key assumptions on the P&L statement.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Microsoft Excel (preferably Excel 2016 or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/financial-forecasting-model.git
   ```
2. Open the Excel file named `P&L_Forecasting_Model.xlsx`.

### Usage

1. **Input Historical Data**: Enter your historical financial data in the designated input cells.
2. **Set Assumptions**: Define your assumptions for revenue growth, cost of goods sold, operating expenses, and other key variables.
3. **Create Scenarios**: Use the Scenario Manager to create and compare different financial scenarios.
4. **Perform Sensitivity Analysis**: Utilize Data Tables to see how changes in assumptions impact your financial projections.
5. **Review Output**: Analyze the dynamic P&L statement and review the projected financial performance.

## Example

Here’s a simple example of how to use the model:

1. Enter historical sales data in the `Sales` input section.
2. Set an annual sales growth rate in the `Assumptions` section.
3. Create a scenario where the sales growth rate is increased by 10%.
4. Use the Data Table to see how this change affects the net income over the 4-year period.
